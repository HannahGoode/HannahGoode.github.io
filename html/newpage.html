<H1> Hip Hop & RnB Evolution </H1>
<p> 
Hip Hop first emerged in the 70's in a predominantly African American economically depressed section of south Bronx of New York in the late 70's 
, later came Grafitti and break dancing which acted as an addition to the Hip Hop movement. But without Dj Kool Herc making the first ever hip hop 
  beat ever known their would be no Hip Hop or RnB Music, DJ Kool Herc (Clive Campbell), 
  was a 18-year-old immigrant who introduced the huge sound systems of his native Jamaica to  inner-city parties in New York. Using two turntables,
  he melded percussive fragments from older records with popular dance songs to create a continuous flow of music. his first public apperance was 
   at his sister's party in the recreation room for the " Back to school jam" on August 11, 1973, although he didn't create music he is 
  the blueprint for hip hop music today.

  which was released in the 80's and sold an estimate of 14 million copies and 50,000 copies a day, was a profit of 3.5 million dollars
