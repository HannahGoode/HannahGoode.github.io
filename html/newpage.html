<H1> Hip Hop & RnB Evolution </H1>
<p> 
Hip Hop first emerged in the 70's in a predominantly African American economically depressed section of south Bronx in New York in the late 70's 
, later came Grafitti and break dancing which acted as an addition to the Hip Hop movement. But without Dj Kool Herc making the first ever hip hop 
  beat ever known their would be no Hip Hop or RnB Music, DJ Kool Herc (Clive Campbell), 
  was a 18-year-old immigrant who introduced the huge sound systems of his native Jamaica to  inner-city parties in New York. Using two turntables,
  he melded percussive fragments from older records with popular dance songs to create a continuous flow of music. his first public apperance was 
   at his sister's party in the recreation room for the " Back to school jam" on August 11, 1973, although he didn't create music he is 
  the blueprint for hip hop music today.

  The first music group to ever make and produce a song using a hip hop beat was The Sugar Hill Gang how made and recorded the song Rappers Delight 
  which was released in the 80's and sold an estimate of 14 million copies and 50,000 copies a day, was a profit of 3.5 million dollars. With this killer
  hit turning hip-hop into mainstream music, rappers started to sign with record labels.One could argue that the outside influence on hip-hop led to the downfall of the hip-hop culture. However, the historical impact on hip
  -hop culture ultimately led hip-hop to have great success by acting as a platform for self-expression, gaining a social significance for
  the African American community and providing a path for kids in the hood to draw themselves away from the drugs, guns, and violence. After this hit it encoureged 
  other to follow hip hop as well, later became many greats like LL Cool JJ, Slick Rick, Ice Tea, Easy-E etc..
