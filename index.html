    I am currently enrolled at Towers High School and I am in the tenth grade and graduate in
    the hopes of becoming and celebrity hairstylist. I moved to Atlanta Georgia in the beginning
    of September, I was born and raised in St.louis Missouri, I have a identical twin sister named
    Anayah.And 5 brothers 2 older 3 younger,I have two aspirations in life and those are to succeed
    and be as happy as I can be 
  </p>
  <p>
    My main hobbies are to attempt to practice hair, listen to poetry and TRY to make some my self
    I also like to design things like rooms on a game or outfits as well. Im very interested in make-up
    but dont wear any my self. I dont plan on going to college because Im going to cosmetology school
    but if all fails I will get a CNA license.
